# Breast-Cancer


A breast is made up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules are the glands that produce milk.

The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together.

Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. 

The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.

Most breast cancers begin in the ducts or lobules. Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. 

When breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.


Kinds of Breast Cancer:

**Invasive ductal carcinoma:** 

The cancer cells begin in the ducts and then grow outside the ducts into other parts of the breast tissue. 

Invasive cancer cells can also spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body.


**Invasive lobular carcinoma:**

Cancer cells begin in the lobules and then spread from the lobules to the breast tissues that are close by. 
These invasive cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body.


# **Breast Cancer App:**

I have created a streamlit Application that is used to predict that if a women has a breast cancer or not.

I used machine learning algorithms such a Support Vector Machine , Radom Forest , LogisticRegression and Knearest neighbour

This is a basic classification model in this you will be able to enter all the required inputs to predict the output Sooner this  wil be updated.
